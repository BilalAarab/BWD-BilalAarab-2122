              <h3>Treatments</h3>
              <p>I use different cupping treatments, from hijama to mugwort cupping. Each cupping therapy can be applied to specific acupuncture points. 
				 These methods are good for both physical and emotional complaints. I always recommend drinking plenty of water after treatment. 
				 If you are not sure which method is right for you, you can always contact us.

			<p>
				The cups are vacuumed by means of a pump, after a few minutes I gently remove the cups and make small scratches on the skin, I repeat this at every place where I have placed the cups. 
				After I have made the scratches, I place the cups back and I vacuum them. This allows the old blood and toxic substances to leave the body. The body works more efficiently due to the self-healing ability of the body, which is stimulated by hijama. 
				This method can also be applied to certain areas, such as knee or shoulder complaints, low back pain, and so on.

				The difference with dry cupping and wet cupping (hijama) is that with this method no scratches are made in the skin and therefore no blood is released, hence the term dry.
				This method can also be applied to certain areas, such as knee or shoulder complaints, low back pain, etc.I do this with glass cups or the cups that I also use for hijama, depending on which area on the body.

				<h2>Massage Cupping</h2>

				<p>
					I use oil on the skin so that I I can massage the cups more easily over the skin, I can do this with different types of cups, plastic, silicone or with glass cups that I vacuum by means of fire. I can also apply it to any area of the body. 
					Targeting specific areas such as the arms and legs for cellulite reduction is also possible. After the treatment, I recommend drinking plenty of water, so that the body can properly dispose of the waste.
